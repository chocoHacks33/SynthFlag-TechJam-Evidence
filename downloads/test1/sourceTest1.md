# TEST1 dataset and evaluation sources

## What TEST1 evaluated

TEST1 used **15,000 unique public images**:

- 5,000 from CIFAKE;
- 5,000 from SID-Set;
- 5,000 from WildFake.

Every image was evaluated twice:

1. as the original clean image;
2. with one deterministic composite augmentation.

This produced **30,000 predictions from 15,000 unique source images**. The augmented rows reuse the same source identities; they are not additional independent images.

TEST1 did **not** use the TikTok TechJam hidden evaluation set.

The binary label convention was:

- `0`: real/non-AIGC;
- `1`: AI-generated, fully synthetic, or AI-tampered.

## 1. CIFAKE

- Dataset split: official CIFAKE test split.
- Full official test pool: 20,000 images.
- TEST1 sample: 5,000 exact-byte-unique images.
- Class balance:
  - 2,500 real CIFAR-10-derived images;
  - 2,500 Stable Diffusion 1.4 generated images.
- Native resolution: every image is `32 × 32` pixels.
- Selection: exact-SHA deduplication followed by deterministic, score-blind salted-hash sampling of 2,500 images per class.
- Clean images were not pre-upscaled outside the model's normal preprocessor.

This is a 5,000-image subset rather than the complete 20,000-image CIFAKE test split.

All CIFAKE images activate the detector's specialised native-longest-side `≤64` branch. Consequently, the CIFAKE result is benchmark-aware and must not be presented as pure unknown-domain generalisation.

Protocol: [CIFAKE protocol](../../datasets/cifake_official/benchmark5000_v1/protocol.json)

## 2. SID-Set

- Dataset split: public SID-Set **validation** split.
- The separately distributed official test split was not used.
- Full public validation pool: 30,000 rows across 34 official Parquet shards.
- TEST1 sample: 5,000 exact-byte-unique images.
- Class composition:
  - 2,500 real images (`SID label 0`);
  - 1,250 fully synthetic images (`SID label 1`);
  - 1,250 AI-tampered images (`SID label 2`).
- For binary evaluation, SID labels 1 and 2 were combined into the positive/AI class.
- Native longest side: 768–1,024 pixels; median 1,024 pixels.
- Selection: deterministic, score-blind cluster sampling of official Parquet row groups, followed by salted-hash row sampling within each SID label.
- Original image bytes were extracted from the official Parquet files without Hugging Face preview re-encoding.

SID is the most manipulation-oriented TEST1 source because half of its positive examples are locally tampered rather than completely generated. It is nevertheless a public validation benchmark, not a hidden test.

## 3. WildFake

- Dataset split: WildFake official 20% test metadata.
- Complete metadata pool: 714,156 rows.
- TEST1 sample: 5,000 exact-byte-unique images.
- Class balance:
  - 2,500 real images;
  - 2,500 AI-generated images.
- Native longest side: 128–5,177 pixels; median approximately 200 pixels.
- Selection: deterministic, score-blind salted-hash sampling, exact-byte deduplication, and hierarchical balancing by source/generator and architecture.

### WildFake real-image sources

The 2,500 real images were distributed across six sources:

| Source | Images |
|---|---:|
| ImageNet | 417 |
| FFHQ | 417 |
| CelebA-HQ | 417 |
| LAION-5B | 417 |
| Church | 416 |
| AFHQ | 416 |

### WildFake generated-image sources

The 2,500 generated images were balanced across three broad generator families:

| Family | Images |
|---|---:|
| Diffusion-based | 834 |
| Other generative architectures | 833 |
| GAN-based | 833 |

The sample covers 15 individual architectures:

- Diffusion: ADM, DDPM, DDIM, Imagen, and VQDM.
- GAN: BigGAN, DF-GAN, GigaGAN, StarGAN, StyleGAN, and GALIP.
- Other: VQGAN, VQVAE, MAGE, and MAE.

DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion fake strata were excluded. Real COCO images were also excluded. This reduced overlap with earlier organizer demonstrations and documented FeatDistill source families, but it does not prove zero exposure through Expert 4 or SigLIP pretraining.

## Clean and augmented evaluation

Each source image contributed exactly two aligned views:

- `clean`: the unmodified source image;
- `composite_standard`: one deterministic 1–5-operation corruption recipe.

For each of the three datasets:

| Number of transformations | Source images |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,000 |
| 2 | 1,000 |
| 3 | 1,000 |
| 4 | 1,000 |
| 5 | 1,000 |

The composite recipes used six transformation families:

| Family | Possible severity/settings |
|---|---|
| JPEG compression | Quality 90, 70, 50, or 30 |
| Gaussian blur | Sigma 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 |
| Resize round trip | Scale 0.5 or 0.25, then bicubic resize back |
| Gaussian noise | Sigma 0.02, 0.05, or 0.10 |
| Colour jitter | Brightness, contrast, or saturation multiplied by 0.8 or 1.2 |
| Centre-crop round trip | Retain 80%, then bicubic resize back |

The recipes were:

- deterministic;
- generated without model scores;
- generated without using the class label;
- applied symmetrically to real and AI images;
- applied in memory, without saving separate augmented image files.

TEST1 did **not** cover harder NTIRE-style operations such as neural compression, invisible watermark insertion, watermark removal, adversarial attacks, or a complete 36-transformation corruption pipeline.

## What TEST1 does and does not establish

An accurate description is:

> TEST1 evaluates the frozen detector on balanced, score-blind 5,000-image subsets from CIFAKE's official test split, SID-Set's public validation split, and WildFake's official test metadata. Each of the 15,000 unique source images is evaluated clean and under one deterministic 1–5-operation composite corruption, producing 30,000 total predictions.

Do not claim that:

- TEST1 used the TikTok hidden test;
- it evaluated the complete CIFAKE, SID-Set, or WildFake collections;
- SID was an official hidden test;
- 30,000 predictions represented 30,000 independent images;
- the three suites were completely unseen throughout model development;
- dataset-external evaluation proves zero generator-family, pixel-level, or backbone-pretraining exposure.

These public suites were inspected during earlier development. TEST1 is therefore a reproducible development benchmark rather than a pristine blind holdout.
